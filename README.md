# LinkedInn Clone

## 🎯 Purpose

This project is a design-focused social network clone inspired by the layout of the [LinkedIn feed page](https://www.linkedin.com). It provides an interface where users can view profile information, browse posts, and explore basic interaction elements.  
The primary goal of this project is to learn and implement the visual and structural design of a modern social networking page.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Used to create the page structure.

- **CSS3** – Used to apply styling and layout

- **Bootstrap-5** – Used for responsive design and ready-made components.

## ✨ Features

- **Semantic structure with HTML5:** Page sections were organized semantically using header, nav, main, section, aside, and footer tags.

- **Bootstrap 5 grid system:** The page layout was built using the Bootstrap grid system, forming a modern three-column structure.

- **Responsive design:** Bootstrap's responsive classes (col-\*, d-none d-md-block, container, row) were used to ensure compatibility across mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

- **Custom CSS enhancements:** Component-level custom styles, variables, and spacing adjustments were defined in a dedicated CSS file.

- **Reusable UI components:** Profile card, post card, news card, and menu structures were designed with a reusable component approach.

- **Icon library integration:** Font Awesome / Bootstrap Icons were integrated for menu icons and interaction buttons.

- **Use of Flexbox and Grid:** Modern CSS layout techniques (Flexbox & Grid) were applied to navigation areas, card interiors, and layout elements.

- **Hover and active state styling:** Hover and active states were defined with custom CSS to provide visual feedback on buttons and menu items.

- **Performance-oriented file structure:** Images were optimized, unnecessary code repetition was reduced, and a clean, readable folder structure was created.

- **Fully frontend-focused setup:** The project was developed solely with HTML–CSS–Bootstrap and does not include any backend or JavaScript functionality.
